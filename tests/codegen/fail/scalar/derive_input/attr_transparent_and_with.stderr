error: GraphQL scalar `with = <path>` attribute argument cannot be combined with `transparent`. You can specify custom resolvers with `to_output_with`, `from_input_with`, `parse_token`/`parse_token_with` attribute arguments and still use `transparent` for unspecified ones.

help: `graphql` is an attribute that can be used by the derive macros `GraphQLEnum`, `GraphQLInputObject`, `GraphQLInterface`, `GraphQLObject`, `GraphQLScalar` and `GraphQLUnion`, you might be missing a `derive` attribute
